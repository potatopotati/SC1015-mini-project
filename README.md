# SC1015-mini-project

## About the project:

A Mini Project for SC1015 (INTRO TO DATA SCI & ART INTELL) that focuses on students' grades from [Student Alcohol Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption) by UCI MACHINE LEARNING. Directory for easy access of resources:
1. [Dataset](https://github.com/potatopotati/SC1015-mini-project/tree/main/archive)
2. [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/potatopotati/SC1015-mini-project/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)
3. [Feature Selection](https://github.com/potatopotati/SC1015-mini-project/blob/main/Feature%20Selection.ipynb)

## Problem statement:

1. What factors affect Student Grades the most?
2. Are we able to predict Student Grades based on those factors?

## Contributions:
1. @Tejaswi002: Data Cleaning, Feature Selection, EDA and Machine Learning
2. @potatopotati: Data Cleaning, Feature Selection, EDA and Machine Learning
3. @nigelip: Data Cleaning, Feature Selection, EDA and Machine Learning

## Models Used:
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest

## Conclusion:
1. We were able to solve the first question and identify the top factors affecting student grades.
2. We were unable to predict student grades using our machine learning models mainly due to lack of enough data and presence of too many categorical variables.
3. In the real world context, our project was able to identify the factors affecting student grades the most. This allows teachers to identify possible students who need extra help and provide more guidance to these students.

## What did we learn?
1. Handling catergorical and binary variables 
2. One Hot Encoding
3. Collab using github
4. Google Colab
5. Feature selection
6. Random Forest
7. Extra Tree Classifier 
8. Plotly
